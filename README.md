# CS225 Docker Virtual Environment
**If you are trying to set up your environment, you are probably looking for: [CS225 Environment Setup](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/resources/own-machine/).**

These are the underlying Dockerfiles for CS225's Docker virtual environment. We are providing this to allow you to verify the contents of the image we distribute. You can also use this as reference to set up your own environment if you wish to do so, but we will not provide help with doing this.
